            <h1 class="margin text-center">Cyoa Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Mr Mueller, my SEP 10 teacher, told us to create or choose our own cyoa project about any adventure out of our imagination or choose based on what others creates. </p>
            <p>So I create an interactive adventure project where the user makes choices that lead to different outcomes. The project is centered around cooking a Korean meal, and the user will navigate through a series of choices related to the ingredients, cooking methods, and final meal preparation. The goal is to provide a branching story with multiple possible outcomes based on user decisions.</p>            
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>For my adventure, I chose the theme of cooking a meal, where the user makes decisions based on what meal they want to prepare. I was assigned a partner who shares similar cooking preferences, so we could collaborate on how the adventure would progress. I started by creating a plan and setting up a basic HTML file and used links to create different pathways, allowing users to choose what ingredients to use, what cooking methods to apply, and ultimately, what dish to prepare.</p>
            <p>The adventure started with two main choices: “Quick and easy” or "Long and complex". From there, the story branched out into smaller decisions like choosing between different types of ingredients. Each choice led to new options, where I created several links within the HTML, each directing to another set of choices, until the user reached the final outcome, a delicious meal they worked hard for. I created separate HTML files for each set of choices and linked them to create a seamless, branching story. I also used CSS to style the pages and make them visually engaging.</p>
               
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p> Our teacher assigned this project to help us practice both programming and creativity. The goal was to understand how branching logic works project, with directories and sub-directories. This project helped me practice essential web development skills, particularly HTML and working with links. </p>
          
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest hurdles I faced during this project was the lack of communication with my partner, especially in class. We were supposed to collaborate, but when it came to discussing ideas and planning during class time, my partner was often quiet and not very engaged. I would try to bring up important points or ask for feedback on how to proceed with the story and design, but most of the time, my partner would stay silent or give short responses. This made it really difficult to move forward as a team.</p>
            <p>During class, we had the opportunity to brainstorm and discuss our approach, but it felt like I was doing most of the talking. I found myself explaining my ideas, asking for input, and even suggesting tasks for us to work on, but my partner rarely participated in the conversation or only worked on some parts of the plan I asked for. This made it challenging to get on the same page, and it felt like I was shouldering the responsibility of figuring everything out on my own.</p>
            <p>At first, I tried to be patient and make an effort to include my partner by asking specific questions or breaking the tasks down into smaller, manageable pieces. However, the lack of involvement in those discussions or work meant I ended up working mostly on my own in class as well as outside of it.</p>
          <p>To handle this, I had to shift my mindset and accept that I couldn’t rely on my partner for active collaboration in the way I had initially hoped. I focused on making the most of the time in class by working through the problems and tasks myself. I also started taking more initiative in the discussions, even if it meant carrying the conversation on my own. I used the class time to refine the project and work independently, while also making sure I stayed on top of any updates or changes.
</p>
          <p>Despite the lack of communication, I realized that I could still make significant progress on my own, and I chose to use the situation as a chance to strengthen my skills in problem-solving, independent work, and time management. In the end, I still produced a project I was proud of, but it was definitely more challenging without active communication and collaboration with my partner.
</p>


            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <p>If I had more time I would add more images as using more visual aids could enhance the user experience and make it feel more like a real cooking adventure. Also if i had the chance to redo the project with a different group, I would prioritize ensuring better communication from the start. I would take a more active role in encouraging my partner to speak up during class, perhaps by setting clearer expectations and creating a more structured plan for how we would work together. In the future, I would also consider reaching out for help sooner if communication issues continued to arise, whether by discussing the problem with the teacher or suggesting a more structured approach to collaboration to make sure everyone is contributing effectively.
