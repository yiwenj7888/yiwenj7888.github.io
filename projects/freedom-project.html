            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>I am a student at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Program. The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.</p>
            <p>For my project, I chose the topic of business.</p>     
            <p>I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study animate.css in order to help me make my website.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Throughout the project, I applied the skills I had developed during the SEP10 course, particularly in web development. The site I created functions as an information provider, highlighting key aspects of modern business and everything from present technologies to ideas for future inventions.</p>
            <p>I began by designing wireframes for the layout of the website, ensuring that each section was clearly defined and that the navigation was easy. The HTML structure was fundamental in organizing the content, while I used Bootstrap to ensure that the design was responsive across different devices. CSS allowed me to personalize the aesthetics, while Animate.css brought life to the content by incorporating subtle animations, making it more engaging for the users.</p>
            <p>After completing the main design, I spent some time refining the user interface, ensuring that the website would look more polished, while remaining easy to use. I also utilized GitHub to manage version control and keep track of progress, which helped me stay organized as I made improvements to the site.</p>
               
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
           
          
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that the website was fully responsive. At the start, I ran into multiple issues with the layout when testing on different screen sizes, especially with mobile views. There were times when elements would overlap or wouldn’t align properly, making the website look messy.</p>
            <p>Overcoming these issues required patience, a lot of trial and error, and a deep dive into Bootstrap’s grid system and CSS media queries. I spent a lot of time tweaking the design, adjusting margins, padding, and flexbox properties to achieve the desired effect.</p>
            <p>Another challenge I faced during this project was integrating Animate.css into the website. Although I had a basic understanding of CSS animations, Animate.css was still reverently a new tool for me. At first, I struggled with timing and making sure the animations weren’t too distracting or out of place. It took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to best apply animations without overwhelming the content. For example, figuring out how to ensure certain elements only animated when the user scrolled to them was a tricky process.</p>
            <p>One thing that helped me was the habit of writing a weekly learning log. Before starting the project, I had committed to keeping a log of everything I learned once I chose my tool, and I continued this practice during the Freedom Project. Each week, I would reflect on the challenges I encountered, the animations I experimented with, and the solutions I found. This log allowed me to track my progress, making it easier to solve problems in future weeks. Writing these logs also kept me on track, as I could refer back to them whenever I felt stuck or needed a reminder of the solutions I had previously discovered.</p>
          


            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>Looking back, I realized that the most valuable takeaway from this project was how much planning ahead helped me. I spent time creating wireframes, mapping out the site’s structure, and brainstorming ideas for what I wanted to include before actually diving into the code. This early planning stage gave me a clearer vision of the project and allowed me to break the work into manageable chunks. It made the whole process smoother and less overwhelming. I could easily identify what sections needed more attention and what elements could be added as the project evolved.</p>
            <p>Writing the weekly learning logs also contributed to this sense of preparedness. It was a way of reflecting on how I could improve and refine my project week by week. Having a record of my thoughts made it easier to plan ahead for the next tasks, as I could look back on previous entries to see which areas still needed improvement. This planning process not only helped with the technical aspects of building the website but also kept me focused on the bigger picture. Instead of jumping into the project without a roadmap, I had a clear structure to follow, which made the decision-making and problem-solving much easier as I went along.</p>
            <p>This was particularly important when dealing with the responsive design issues. Instead of getting frustrated, I learned to break down each problem into smaller, more manageable parts and tackle them one by one. Using grid system, I was able to structure the content more effectively, ensuring that everything resized properly on different screen sizes. The grid system made it far easier to create a flexible layout that adjusted automatically to screen sizes.</p>


          
            <h4>Next steps</h4>
            <p>If I had more time to continue refining this project, I would focus on making the website more interactive. While the content and animations were a great starting point, I think adding more engaging features would make the website more engaging and enjoyable to use. For example, I’d incorporate additional animations and transitions to make the user experience feel more immersive. I could animate the navigation bar or add hover effects to buttons and links, providing subtle yet engaging  visual design for the users.</p>
